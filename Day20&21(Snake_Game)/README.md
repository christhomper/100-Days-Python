# 🐍 Nagini's Labyrinth (Snake Game)

A classic Snake game remake using Python's turtle graphics. Eat food, grow your snake, and avoid collisions with the walls or yourself.

## 🚀 Features

- Smooth snake movement
- Food spawning at random locations
- Score tracking
- Game over screen on collision with wall or self
- Expandable code structure using classes

## 🕹 Controls

- `Arrow Keys` – Move the snake (Up, Down, Left, Right)

## 📦 Files

- `app.py` – Main game loop and input handling
- `snake.py` – Snake movement and growth logic
- `food.py` – Food placement and refresh behavior
- `scoreboard.py` – Score display and game-over handling

## 🎮 How to Play

1. Run `app.py`.
2. Control the snake using arrow keys.
3. Eat food to grow longer and increase your score.
4. Avoid hitting the walls or your own body.
5. See how long you can survive!

## 🧠 Inspiration

Inspired by the original Snake game found on old mobile phones, this project is a great way to practice Python OOP and graphics programming with the turtle module.
