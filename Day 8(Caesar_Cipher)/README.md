# 🔐 Caesar Cipher

A simple encryption and decryption tool based on the Caesar cipher algorithm. This program shifts each letter in your message by a number of positions in the alphabet.

## ▶️ Features

- Encode (encrypt) and decode (decrypt) messages
- Handles non-alphabet characters without altering them
- Automatically wraps around the alphabet (e.g. z + 2 → b)
- Continuous loop until the user chooses to exit
- Supports lowercase text input

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced

- Functions and parameter handling
- Loops and conditionals
- List indexing and modular arithmetic
- User input and control flow
- Basic string manipulation
