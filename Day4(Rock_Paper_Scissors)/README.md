# ‚úäüñê‚úåÔ∏è Rock Paper Scissors

A simple command-line implementation of the classic Rock Paper Scissors game using Python.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How It Works

- The user selects Rock (0), Paper (1), or Scissors (2).
- The computer randomly selects one of the three options.
- The game displays ASCII art representations of both choices.
- The outcome (win, lose, or draw) is determined based on classic RPS rules.

## üß† Concepts Practiced

- Using `random.randint()` for randomness
- Working with lists for storing and accessing data
- Input validation
- Conditional logic with `if`, `elif`, `else`
- Formatting output with ASCII art and string interpolation
