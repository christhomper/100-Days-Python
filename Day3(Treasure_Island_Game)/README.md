# 🏝️ Treasure Island

An interactive, text-based adventure game built in Python. Make choices and see where the story takes you — find the treasure or meet your doom!

## ▶️ How It Works

The player navigates a series of choices:
1. A crossroad: left or right?
2. A lake: swim or wait for a boat?
3. A house with three doors: red, yellow, or blue?

Each decision leads to a different outcome. Only one path leads to the treasure — others end the game.

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced

- Conditional logic with `if`, `elif`, and `else`
- Using `.lower()` to handle case-insensitive input
- String formatting and multi-line text
- Basic input/output interaction
