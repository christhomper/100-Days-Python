# ✏️ Etch-a-Sketch

A simple drawing program using Python's `turtle` module. This digital version of the classic Etch-a-Sketch lets you control a turtle with your keyboard to draw on the screen.

## ▶️ Controls

- `W` – Move forward
- `S` – Move backward
- `A` – Turn left
- `D` – Turn right
- `C` – Clear the screen and reset position
- Click the screen to exit

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced

- Event listeners and keyboard bindings with `onkey()`
- Turtle movement and heading control
- Clearing and resetting the turtle with `.clear()`, `.home()`, and `.penup()`
- Basic interactive graphics using `turtle`
